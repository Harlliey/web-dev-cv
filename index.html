        <h2>Jianwei Zhuang</h2>
        <p class="intro">In my childhood, my mother always shared the line chart of her stock account with me,
        on which the colorful lines impressed me a lot. When I grow up, I implemented some Data Visualization projects as well.
        After those practice, I started to wondering some theoretical problems like why should I utilize pie chart instead of other charts in the project?
        or how much data should I pick for this particular visualization? Therefore, I choose this course to seek for the answers.</p>

        <h2>Good Example</h2>
        <div class="skill-row">
          <img height="350px" width="350px" class="coding-img" src="images/population.gif" alt="coding">
          <h3>Percent of U.S. population by age group, 1950-2060</h3>
          <p>This is a good example of Data Visualization because it is crystal clear and simple. The aim of this visualization is to demonstrate
          the percent of population by age group in a period of time. Instead of placing all the charts together for the readers to cpmpare by themselves,
          the author of this chart make it into an animation, which easily shows the trend of population changing in different dimensions. We can easily get
          useful information and draw conclusions from the demograph.</p>

        <h2>Bad Example</h2>
        <div class="skill-row">
          <img height="300px" width="800px" class="coding-img" src="images/heat.png" alt="coding">
          <h3>Coronavirus heat map</h3>
          <p>I regard this one as a bad example of Data Visualization. At first glance, this is a heat map, but actually, it should be regarded as an "anti-heat" heat map.
           We’re wired to see the darkest or strongest color as having the highest amount of something, the lightest color as having the least in a heat map.
           The graph above goes against this assumption, the highest number of Covid-19 cases, “10,001 or more”, is represented by a lighter color than the lowest number, “None”.
           There’s literally no logic to the rest of the colors either. This example is strongly against the readers' nature.</p>
